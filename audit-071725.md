## Game plan

- One of the main underlying issues is our performance, especially on mobile devices
- Another massive issue is our google business profile. 7 reviews, 3.7 stars, 45+ years in business? doesn't add up
- It doesn't matter how good our content is, if we aren't providing a good experience google does not care

### Week 1

- Remove video from hero section
- Update h1 copy - current is "Coil processing"
- Add dynamic copyright
- Remove fragmented identifiers from URLs
- Remove excessive & slow animations (300ms max) (https://cpec.com/applications/ - example)
- Disable autoplay on all videos

### Week 2

- Simplify & restructure the navbar (remove duplicates & fine tune)
- Update all internal links and use proper redirects
- Clean the url structure (huge when it comes to site crawling)
  - https://cpec.com/why-coe/news/ news shouldn't be a child of why-coe
  - https://cpec.com/equipment/complete-lines/cut-to-length/ this link falls under Equipment & Applications

### Week 3

- Build structured templates for equipment and applications
- Add schema markup to key pages
- Expand site search to include equipment, applications, services, and parts - not just blogs
- Add website manifest - page for LLM

### Additional

- Legal pages - not modals
- Look into theme - 30,000+ redirects
- Incentivize our customers to leave more reviews
- Overall design rework - black seems lazy
- Super weird scroll behavior on multiple pages - https://cpec.com/service/#pm-support
- Structure equipment & applications information for programmatic SEO
- Establish 4-5 content pillars
- Glossary for industry terms - not as effective since latest google bot update
